Performance was close to what was expected. Insertion has a best case of n and average case of n^2 so as the number grew computation time rose dramatically making it the slowest overall. Radix sort and std::sort were similar although the average radix is nk, where k is the constant number of digits, and std::sort is nlog(n) meaning std sort should do better in the long run. std::sort uses introsort which is hybrid sorting algorithm that starts with quicksort and then switches to heapsort at a certain size. I was surprised at the scaling of my insertion sort, as it is n^2 so I expected a exponential curve on my graph but because that is only the average case my results varied between trials.
